# Orchestration Package

This package now owns the Phase 3 CPU-friendly courtroom runtime baseline.

Current scope:

- LangGraph-based simulation flow
- legal retrieval handoff into argument generation
- structured plaintiff, defense, judge, and clerk turns
- runtime state transitions for `/simulate`

The runtime is rule-based for now and is designed to be upgraded later with stronger agent reasoning while preserving the same shared contracts.
